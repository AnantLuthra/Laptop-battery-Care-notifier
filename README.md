# Laptop Battery care notifier
### This is a battery care notifier which will take care of our laptop's batter by sending notification.
---
## Basic logic
- As we know our battery get depreciated over the years, but It is known that if we keep our battery percentage between 40 and 80 so it will keep our laptop battery good. 
---
## Features
- So this program will see if the laptop is on charging so what is the percentage if it is going above 85% it will send notification to put off the charger.
- And if laptop is not connected with charger and not charging it will simply check the percentage if it's going below 35% it will send notifcation to connect the charger.
- As having a laptop we have to care about it's battery so here is the solution.
